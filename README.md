This is a small project with the main goal of trying out flutter by touching on as many points as possible. so far we've got some of experience with:

 - UI and Navigation;
 - Using an API;
 - Accessing the camera, taking a picture and saving that file to perform some kind of action;
 - Share a file;
 - Access the gallery;
 - Dialogs;

Hopefully by the end we can still get some time with databases and data management, and possibly dynamically changing the whole app feel (light/dark mode).

Some pictures and where they exist in the app:
 - Home screen:
 - Sidebar:
 - Settings Screen:
 - Camera Screen:
 - API Screen:
